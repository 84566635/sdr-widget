SDR-Widget is an interface based on the Atmel AT32UC3A3 microcontroller that provides the following functionality to SDR circuits such as the SoftRock.

   1. High quality audio using the USB Audio Class standard (UAC1 and UAC2)
   2. PTT control
   3. Si570 control
   4. SWR metering
   5. PWR metering
   6. PA Heatsink Temperature metering
   7. PA bias adjustment
   8. LCD display
   9. Rotary Encoder Input
  10. Filter bank switching control
  11. CW paddle 

The interface also aims to be used as a general platform for future experimentation with SDR peripherals.

A branch of the widget, called the audiophile-widget, will provide the USB-I2S module for mating with various Analog Board (AB) designs featuring different DAC, IV conversion, buffer/amplification, and power supplies. AB-1 is based on the ES9022 DAC.  One the AB's will feature an FPGA for added functionalities.
